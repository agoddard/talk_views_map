allow running w/o basemap
  - it looks kinda cool on a plain black background
data clustering rake tasks
  - should supply time&space clustering options. build output file named w/ these options.
build rake file tasks for output files. be smarter about when to rebuild them.
  - when input files are updated, output files should be rebuilt
  - allow ingest & output, of different date ranges, clustering strategies, etc
  - animation should be able to read them via cli options
design standard input file format & allow configuation via cli?
  - date/time, lat, lon, size, color
  - would require output-file preprocessing to add color & size info
add 'how to use this'
add 'how to set up your environment'
  - stick w/ ruby 1.8 syntax? then anyone could run via rp5
  - or start using 1.9, which means people would have to install their own jruby & use --1.9
fine-tune JVM args and save somewhere
  -J-Xmx1024m -J-Xss2048k -Xmemory.max=2048m -Xstack.max=4096k
  - this is probably massive overkill since jconsole says we're not actually using all that much ram
add github pages for the project, or flesh out the wiki
  - how can i do image hosting on github? clone wiki repo & upload there.
